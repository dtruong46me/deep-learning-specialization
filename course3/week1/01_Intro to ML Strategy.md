## Chain of Assumption in Machine Learning

- **Fit training set well cost function**: bigger network, Adam,...
- **Fit dev set well on cost function**: regularization, bigger training set,...
- **Fit test set well on cost function**, bigger dev set,...
- **Perform well in real world**: change dev set, cost function,...
