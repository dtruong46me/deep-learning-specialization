## Improve the Model

**Reduce Avoidable Bias:**

- Train a bigger model (more layers, units, parameters) to fit training data better
- Train longer with more epochs
- Use better optimization algorithms like momentum, RMSprop, Adam
- Try different model architectures (RNN, CNN, etc) and hyperparameters

**Reduce Variance:**

- Get more training data
- Use regularization (L2, dropout, data augmentation)
- Try different model architectures and hyperparameters
- Find the right balance between bias and variance

**Other methods:**

- Preprocess data better - clean, normalize, engineer features
- Try ensemble and averaging of multiple models
- Use better quality data - reduce noise, outliers, missing values
- Try different model types - SVM, random forest, etc beyond neural nets
- Tune all hyperparameters via grid/random search
- Iteratively increase model complexity for better fit
- Fix errors in training data and evaluation metrics
